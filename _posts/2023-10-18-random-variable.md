## Random Variable

A lot of Machine Learning is concerned with figuring out the probability of an unknown outcome, which in it's simplest form is a random variable.

To backup a bit, it may be helpful to explain what a variable is. A variable is a symbol that represents an unknown mathematical object, which is very wordy for something we've seen before all over the place. For example: x+1=2 has a variable 'x'.

We have variables just so we can reference to a mathematical object without specifically naming it. This comes in really handy when we want to generalize an equation over all possible situations. For example if you only had $5 the number of bananas you can purchase is dependent on the price of the bananas or in other words, x*y <= 5 where x = # of bananas and y = price of the bananas. As a result all banana conveyors could use this formula, thanks variable!


Attempting to transition to random variables, the first question that seems to come up is, what makes a variable 'random'? Variables become random when they come as a result of a random process. 

How can we really talk about random variables?

The tricky thing is how we think about linear regression's input variables, are these Random or not?
