## Bayes Theorem


Probability is always easy with examples, especially engaging ones.

For this we'll picture you're a short Asian guy on a dating app (aka me off and on several years ago). After reading this depressing [article](https://theconversation.com/asian-guys-stereotyped-and-excluded-in-online-dating-130855) you come to realize that 90% of non-Asian women want nothing to do with you (romantically that is). Yet you continue swiping with a false feeling that you're special, with your current odds of being 10% chance of matching if the person is non-Asian (successful assimilation has made you primarily attracted to non-Asian females).


As you're swiping you come across an attractive white brunette and after some Instagram sleuthing, you've seen that her ex-boyfriend was Asian (and presumably still is). Hooray! But then you remember you're short.

However, since she's the same height you still have a shot? 61% of women who date Asians also date men the same height or shorter than them after all (accoridng to some article you can no longer find).

So given these stats you oddly have memorized and the the new information gained from your Instagram sleuthing (creeping) how have your odds changed?

Let's do some math! 

Or first let's at least diagram what we know.

We start with the whole universe of non-Asian females on a dating app (pretend there's a million dots in the circle that represent women that will very unlikely swipe right).

We can create two squares in here that represent the small world (or sample) in the universe that both: date short guys and date Asian guys.

Oh, but we forgot of course there's overlap where there are some (not a lot) of non-Asian women out there who will date a guy who is both Asian and short. Let's update our diagram to account for this.

Neat!

So we've just been defining the sample space through drawing shapes with random sizes, let's apply the evidence we've learned along with some of the weird stats you were stating earlier.

It should really be this size

So the new evidence we've learned is that she is open to dating Asian men due to her past relationship. As a result we can filter down to the world in which women are open to dating Asian men. 

Circled.

Filtered.

Our updated question becomes, what's the probability that given 


blah blah blah


**Bayes Theorem**

\[P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)}\]
