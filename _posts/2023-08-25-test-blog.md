## Bayes Theorem & Law of Total Probability


Probability is always easy with examples, especially engaging ones.

For this we'll picture you're a short Asian guy on a dating app (aka me off and on several years ago). After reading this depressing article [link here] you come to realize that 90% of non-Asian women want nothing to do with you (romantically that is). Yet you continue swiping with a false feeling that you're special, with your current odds of being 10% chance of matching if the person is non-Asian (assimilation has made you mainly attracted to non-Asian females).


As you're swiping you come across an attractive female and after some Instagram sleuthing, you've seen that her ex-boyfriend was Asian (and presumably still is). Hooray! But then you remember you're short.

However, since she's the same height you still have a shot? 51% of women date men of the same height or shorter after all. 

Lastly, you somehow know (and weirdly have all these stats memorized) that 60% of the time if a woman dates Asian guys she is also open to dating shorter guys.

**Bayes Theorem**

\[P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)}\]

So given these odd facts you have handy and the the new information gained from your Instagram sleuthing how have your odds changed?

Let's do some math!
